# teal_demo_2023

Teal viz following instructions from Oct 2023

Just run the "first_steps.R" and "second_steps.R" script to have installed the libraries and ensuring the dashboards work on your local.

So far the content is not available to deploy in shinyapp.io. Looking forward to see if they can be deployed in Posit.io or RSconnect server.

You should be able to see the following tabs:
